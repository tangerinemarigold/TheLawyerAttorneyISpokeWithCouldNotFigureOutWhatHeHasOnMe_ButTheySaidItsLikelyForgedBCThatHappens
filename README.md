# TheLawyerAttorneyISpokeWithCouldNotFigureOutWhatHeHasOnMe_ButTheySaidItsLikelyForgedBCThatHappens

My former coworker, the one who couldn't leave said I can completely see them (both Jason and Paul) doing something like that.

How did they accomplish any/all of this???

The attorney & lawyer (who work together) said, in their experience, it comes down to a forged document. 

That's the only thing that makes sense to me. What else
