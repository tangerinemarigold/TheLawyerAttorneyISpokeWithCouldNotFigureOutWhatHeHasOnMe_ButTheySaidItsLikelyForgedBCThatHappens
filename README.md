# TheLawyerAttorneyISpokeWithCouldNotFigureOutWhatHeHasOnMe_ButTheySaidItsLikelyForgedBCThatHappens

My former coworker, the one who couldn't leave said I can completely see them (both Jason and Paul) doing something like that.

How did they accomplish any/all of this???

The attorney & lawyer (who work together) said, in their experience, it comes down to a forged document. 

That's the only thing that makes sense to me. What else

cant they face jail time for forgery, even better, good riddance lunatics

to my knowledge, they did not go after anyone else, just me
