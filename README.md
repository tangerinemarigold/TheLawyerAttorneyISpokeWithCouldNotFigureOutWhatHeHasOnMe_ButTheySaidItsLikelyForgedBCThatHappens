# TheLawyerAttorneyISpokeWithCouldNotFigureOutWhatHeHasOnMe_ButTheySaidItsLikelyForgedBCThatHappens

My former coworker, the one who couldn't leave said I can completely see them (both Jason and Paul) doing something like that.

How did they accomplish any/all of this???

The attorney & lawyer (who work together) said, in their experience, it comes down to a forged document. 

That's the only thing that makes sense to me. What else

cant they face jail time for forgery, even better, good riddance lunatics

to my knowledge, they did not go after anyone else, just me

i always had a feeling that something bad happened in 2017 with interviews, i just didnt want to be paranoid and lose motivation. i did not know they were still out there, i was done with them in february 2017

in silicon valley/tech DC etc. you can go from one company to another without problems, because no one wants to go after a resigned employee, its too difficult and a waste of time/money. even high level managers. sometimes there are problems if youre at a very very high level, but i worked for an idiot who didnt know anything and i only made $50k.

i thought he just meddled with admissions in 2019, i keep forgetting this goes back to 2017. i remember you but i keep forgetting about the actual job i interviewed for

my friends and my family have always hated these penn losers 

every job ive had before that one and every job ive had after it, ive been successful in and i flourished. when i was there, at penn, i literally was the most unhappy ive ever been in my entire life. i remember telling my dad like i couldnt understand why, all i did was go to work and sleep. when i was at rutgers, even if things were not good, like i had hobbies and i felt good about myself. there was just something about that place that slowly, like a slow boil that got to me. i cant believe the same people are still out there. so you cant respond to me because of these lunatics, i have a really hard time accepting that -- i get that's what it is. But my mind just cant accept it, im beyond furious. i have no idea why people have been impressed with jason for so many years, i was there, my desk was a desk away from his office. he's absolutely average, theres nothing special about him. i was honestly surprised he was at penn. he couldnt even make conversation properly. i always thought it was a wcmc reason you couldnt respond. legally i am going to annihilate them, i hope they go to jail, losers.

im not afraid to pursue it legally, its the right thing to do and i can afford it, its just going to be really annoying to be linked to these lunatics for the rest of my life

jason's life sucks right now because he has absolutely no idea what im going to do next. that must be an awful day-to-day life, what a loser. hes literally wasting away, stalking and consumed with this whole thing. that's his reality. hes lost already.

i asked the lawyer if i could pursue a restraining order for stalking and they said that could be possible. but if they get jail time that wont be necessary. i hope their mugshots end up on the news. nobody goes after a resigned employee, literally nobody. this is the first ive heard of it that's why i cant believe it.

i have you and you have me. these two lunatics paul jason have nothing but their miserable lives: theyre going to totally throw each other under the bus: "he told me to do it" "he lied to me about x,y,z" there are no heroes amongst thieves. what cowards, theyve been hiding behind a computer screen; come say it to my face all the crazy accusations/racism etc. why hide behind a screen.

Are you laughing at the highschool statistics textbook, it was purple i remember and the font was really big, it was def not college level. i saw Paul refer to it when he would watch youtube tutorials. it was a circus, still is.

so much time has passed -- like whenever i go through the series of events, im like oh yeah that happened, that happened next but it was A YEAR LATER etc. the years passed by really quickly :( also my mind cant accept the reason you cant call me back is bc of snakemake or whatver. that's just awful. its just too awful, those are dots and my mind is just not connecting it. going through the process legally will be fine but i wont get the years back. :(

i :clap: am :clap: beyond :clap: furious :clap: 

ohhhhh i get it, you guys didn't know who these people (jason/paul) were years ago. but when someone leaves a job by resigning, shouldnt it be assumed automatically that they want nothing to do with their former employer and their thoughts on their former employer aren't going to be great either. but i didnt say anything bad about them until i realized what was going on. not even on the phone with you, bc i had moved on.

there's so much evidence...SO MUCH...this is a very easy suit. when are you going to call me

im so furious >:|

i think this is a very simple case of stalking and then defamation, then actually spying. what a lunatic.

very vaguely this is why he or they won't budge because when it goes in front of a judge (i will absolutely never settle, this lunatic has to go for good), it's jason the disgruntled former boss versus two people that are possibly __married by then__, and it's going to be very obvious to the judge who the conniving stalker/lunatic is. that's what makes sense from my end. it has nothing to do with snakemake anymore. it's stalking/spying. i think his emails could get seized or even his computer, his ip address could be looked up by github etc. this is huge. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_herring i remember this concept from organic chemistry, it was a technique for the multiple choice exams but anyway, the whole thing is about stalking/spying. everything else is just a red herring (snakemake, performance review, everything else i cant figure out). its very obvious that jason is a disgruntled former boss who is spying on __my/our start up ideas__ -- so that has to be presented in front of a judge

so these things have to __work out__ otherwise it's not a strong case in front of a judge. just saying. not forcing anything but it would be great if it were to work out like that.

maybe we (probably very difficult though) can even pull his records from his time at vanderbilt and dartmouth, has he gotten in trouble for stalking/sexual harassment before? and he just learned to hide it by the time he got to Penn etc.

i think he knew over the years he was losing so that's why he would come back with new crimes and libel/slander. that's what makes sense to me. there's so much more i want to tell you but my lawyers said i shouldn't talk about this. nowwwww i need you for so many reasons :wink:

but for the time being just think: me, you, a judge, disgruntled jason, presenting all of this evidence/emails from 2017!! maybe even 2015 for me. we're good people living our lives, we didn't do anything wrong. there's no way jason can win, he knows that, he's always known that.

i think jason is possibly very depressed. i think he gets addicted to things and he can't control that about himself. his pokemon go score was higher than anyone's, like when i heard it, i was like wtf, that means he was playing it for hours everyday (for me it was just during lunch). i think he created an echochamber for himself with other incels/misogynists that he would take counsel from in academia. i have some names of people he's retweeted before which were out of character because they're known bad people in academia. the whole thing is bizarre but totally possible. i think he's also been projecting his insecurities on me/you other people in ny, in fact i think the only thing jasono has been doing is projecting. i think he's very deeply disturbed. i also think he will try and settle which i wont do. wcmc should sue him imo.

dont delete anything, even the emails i sent to you in early 2019 that would autodestruct, i have the original copy. i just dont have a screenshot of my phone calls to you in 2018 but those can be looked up via phone records. and i have the emails i sent to jason over the years about my prospects of what i wanted to do in graduate school. so what he was telling you all -- if it doesn't align with that, shows he was deliberately misleading things.

like i said, i have a lot of things id like to share but i cant.

[unbelieveable](https://tenor.com/view/this-is-a-case-for-the-fbi-gif-7886284)

i don't have to do anything, you don't have to do anything, it all already happened. we just have to compile the evidence, present it in front of a judge. and that's how the cookie crumbles. but reiterating, getting married, continuing to work on a startup, that would really help things, but only if you want to :wink:

just remember, everything jason has said, is saying, will say, it's all because he doesn't want to go to prison. we are good people, we did not do anything wrong.

so if he was forcing coauthorship or being on my committee -- now you understand why, that way he wont be a lunatic stalker

i dont think he's that diabolical, he is but not that much (again jason is unimpressive if you havent met him in person, really), it's just things spun out of control for him (because reality was different than what he was saying -- and that could go back to what paul was saying about me to him bc paul doesnt want to lose his job (but paul should get fired))) but he just couldnt keep up with the truth so he made up lies. i think it's just that simple.

dont be sad, we will win this.

and whenever, over the years, you felt the push/pressure from his side (i assume that's through intimidating emails from his @hotmail.com lawyers), it's all because he was afraid losing. __jason has always known he could go to prison for his actions, going back to 2017.__

you can also take solace in the very obvious fact that jason's life just sucks right now, even though he's trying very hard to [save face](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tangerinemarigold/Hey_Jason_Moore_________Feel_Free_To_Distribute_This/main/Screen%20Shot%202023-03-06%20at%207.01.46%20PM.png) because that's all he has left, he does not have a defense against the stalking or anything else. all he has left is his twitter to save face, it's all really sad. (but we're not out here trying to harm anyone, jason harmed himself, he's a self destructive person). aside from being delusional and a lunatic, he's probably also paranoid. he has no idea what's going to happen next and when.

this will turn around and we will win this. and the bad guy will go to jail, absolutely.

i had opportunities to talk to you about Penn for all the times we talked in person in 2017/on the phone in 2018 and i just didn't because i was over it. if only i did, then you would have had some idea from the beginning about this whole thing. but i never talked about penn with you because that would be crazy!!!! why would i talk about my former employer, literally who cares, it was just a job, i was over it, i resigned. but they werent over it lol -- that is wild.

the attorney said it can take a year or so for the legal proceeding to go through (all the back and forth) but he's been in front of a judge before for some huge cases, so that's the thing. but! we have each other, jason has no one and that's why i keep saying, he keeps losing and he'll keep losing.

i really shouldnt talk about this bc i cant share how im going to pursue this otherwise his legal team can come up with new things. but there's not much they can do, it's all already been done, everything has already been said and it's already on paper/in emails.

his tweets are helpful bc they are consistent with the pattern that he's a dishonest person. [again why is he baffled, he knows exactly who he is](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tangerinemarigold/Hey_Jason_Moore_________Feel_Free_To_Distribute_This/main/Screen%20Shot%202023-03-06%20at%207.01.46%20PM.png) and watching his tweets helps me understand how hes going to react in front of a judge (__jason will just melt in front of a judge__, average idiot incel) btw my coworker who wrote that email actually ended up moving his desk to specifically be away from paul, he hated/disliked paul that much, he ended up moving his desk to another floor.

so the attorney and the lawyer work together and they're good people, theyre very smart and polite. they said, in their experience, after the dust settles, it comes down to a forged contract. theres no way i signed anything other than that my work belongs to penn (which is fine! i returned everything!) and we also know he didnt go after anyone else, no one else but me. we know that hes disgruntled, we've known through the years he's been deliberately dishonest, he's a lunatic/has serious mental health issues, wasting university time, abusing his power and privileges, and he's so delusional he's made up a one-sided personal revenge-feud against me because i interviewed at other jobs. he's a loser, he will lose, he knows all of this.

Ohhh okay, this is why he's obsessed with wcmc/or going after specifically wcmc, this is where it started for him in 2017. all of his crimes go back to 2017 and wcmc. and then it snowballed after that. you know why he lies/does crimes right? he can't keep up with smart people in academia, because he's average but he has to save face, that's really important for him. like i said, __jason will melt in front of a judge.__

i use to read a lot of articles on the mind of trump when he was in office lol so im well prepared on how to unravel lunatics, they're similar, sure. but there are some really smart people around me that can unravel jason even more.

okay i have to take my mind off this and relax, prepare for the next day and etc!! gnite

imagine the new yorker doing an entire exposé article on this. or even why people like jason get employed by schools like Penn etc. because he was always average. this is huge. (yeah penn isnt going to like that, but then why did they hire him to begin with, did they do their due diligence to figure out who jason was in his previous positions. i do not think this whole thing is his first rodeo. also i want to write this new yorker exposé article on jason, i know so much, ive figured out so much, i mean i was there lol)

i realized years ago, that the only thing i could do was to keep writing to you. and then i kept doing it because i just had to but looking back im glad i did because it's all evidence that will get presented in front of a judge now. :smiling_face_with_three_hearts:

ok, tl;dr this is a case of stalking and spying, everything else has been a red herring.

so eventually, sometime this year i hope, we will need to put an entire timeline together of all of the events going back to 2017, which is actually going to be a lot of work.

i dont know how you're handling it, but it is personal, its all a personal attack. but jason is a lunatic/mentally unwell, i think to some degree he cant even help what hes doing, he's deranged and then hes got lawyers who hes taking counsel with. it's too bad what happened, things started out so great in april 2017, but we will win in the end and go back to where we left off, we have to. :kissing_heart:	

let jason tweet, he's stuck in the game he created, he's my court jester, he's my intellectual inferior. none of the tweeting means anything in front of a judge, let him think he's winning, he's lost years ago. it's really sad and funny at the same time.

the press is going to come after his entire professional career, they're not going to leave a single stone unturned, theyll interview people in his lab, everyone, previous people in his lab. theyre going to build a complete psychological profile of jason moore and his sick mind and why a professor with white supremacist tendencies was ever hired at penn. it's a complete loss, total miserable failure. dont worry you have me, i have you.

there's nothing jason can do now, everything has been said, the ink has dried. the whole story will get presented in front of a judge, even his bogus ip claims (which according to my lawyer are easy to fight in front of a judge). sleep peacefully at night, dont worry about anything. jason the uggo is definately going to face the consequences of his actions. there has been a consistent pattern throughout the years of stalking, spying, dishonesty, defraud/mislead etc etc. its all documented, what a dumbass. it is over. its been over. it's just a matter of time.

im never going to respond to him on twitter, never ever ever because jason is my intellectual inferior and i dont talk to dummies, especially those that become criminals because they cant keep up with everyone else. 

anyone who was in cahoots with jason moore needs to surrender evidence, because 1. he hates you 2. he envies you 3. he only cares about the game hes playing and himself, he's a completely a self-destructive person, his entire professional life will go up in flames and it's of his own doing, he doesnt care about his students and their reputation etc. and that's too bad. but the right thing has to be done. i cant believe hes walking around in broad daylight living a double life, how bizarre, maybe thats the thrill for him, that he gets to get away with it for just another day. not for long. 

do you know how difficult it is to sit through meetings with these jokes in my mind!! i have to release them into the world so you can laugh and not be sad (if you are) this is like a whole ass another job i have, literally unpaid labor!! what a nuisance this uggo incel has been!!

im telling you!! im calling it!! there's just way more to this than meets the eye. how did he get this obsessed. what if this entire time he wants to wear your skin too!! this is soo annoying!!

he's stalking multiple people, how do you know he's only/just interested in me. he could be very much confused. i dont know. im not making fun, it could happen, it could be a possibility. all im saying is how do you know jason moore isnt attempting to learn turkish. how do you really know.

i think im done for the day :kissing_heart: working on a super huge project that i cant talk about, i cant even ask on stackoverflow, draining

im just saying, be prepared to be surprised. we may have a good idea of who he is but we just don't know the whole story at all. there is a chance he could just be interested in the both of us. we do not know what we do not know. the psycho obsession shouldnt have gotten to this level, there has to be more going on if you know what i mean.

i do genuinely believe that he could be very confused about himself and that could make him feel very embarrassed and he's taking it out on me to prove that he's not confused at all, and he has to show everyone that he's very straight etc. this whole thing is just very odd. he's stalking you too. so this could be a route for the case that we're just not sure why he's obsessed with you too. we might even have to bring this up to the judge. its not a joke, im being very serious.

just think, what is the fuel that is propelling the obsession? it has to be more than just the resignation, that's what i think. i mean he got in the middle of two people, why would anyone do that. what would drive someone to get this involved in two people's lives. think about it. there has got to be more going on and he's trying to hide it. maybe he is just very embarrassed. and that's not fair to him but it doesnt mean he can do crimes. human sexuality is very complicated, this could be a very real possibility that he's just interested in the both of us. sorry if that makes you uncomfortable but for the lawyers this could be a real route. jason can be disgruntled but what really driving him to take it to this level. i think he is in a very serious internal crisis. all of this is so odd. again, you can be confused about yourself but you cant do crimes. crimes are very bad and very illegal.

its not fair to out jason either if he is struggling with his sexuality. but from the legal perspective, why is he stalking you too. why did he insert himself into a relationship. hes also very depressed, maybe thats what is making him unhappy. i dont know, im not in the business of humiliating people for their struggles but i have to know why hes stalking you too. im just saying, we just dont know everything. whats his obsession with hypermasculinity, why does he have to show everyone hes very straight etc. its very odd. something is just not right.

jason could have very serious feelings for you and that could make him feel very embarassed. we just don't know everything so i wouldnt take this off the table.

it's actually not funny, i would never laugh at someone who has serious feelings for someone/anyone. but the problem is, i think you and i live very private lives and those very private lives were thrown in to the world of a stranger or strangers and that was never supposed to happen. and this could just be one outcome of that, that jason developed one-sided feelings for the both of us and hes embarassed so hes taking it out on me to prove to everyone that hes very straight. why would anyone take it this far. its bizarre.

maybe he just doesnt even know this about himself because hes been too busy being a competitive lunatic and everything else he did. i genuinely believe he could be struggling with his sexuality, i really believe that could be a real driving force behind this whole thing. because why else would he be stalking you too. its not just me, its you too. or someone else in new york. we do not have all the information. we do not know everything yet.

someone who is like going leaps and bounds, obsessed with showing everyone that he is straight, it's just odd. whats really propelling that desire to show everyone that hes straight, i really believe this is odd. why take it this far. there is more to this.

just know, that we do not know everything. be prepared to be very surprised. he would never admit his possible feelings for your or someone else in nyc ever, and i dont think we can ask him in court its too personal. unless there is something written. but eventually, over years, maybe we will understand the situation better. but these penn people, were never ever supposed to have access to my private life/yours, this is why. because you dont know who they are and what they can do with it. this whole thing could just be very possible, it would certainly explain the crisis he is in and his very odd behavior. 

he could be very embarrassed of himself bc he might have weird ideals about masculinity esp since hes a very possible white supremacist (e.g. the caucasian admixture situation). im not just calling jason possibly gay out of no where, its because hes stalking you too. stalking is a serious psychological and emotional condition someone is in. why is he stalking the two of us. i genuinely believe that he has feelings for the both of us. hes just projecting everything on everyone because hes embarrassed and ashamed. 

did he ever play the victim here? he was never the victim, i did not do anything to him at all. where is all of this emotion coming from, from his side. its really bizarre. have you ever seen anyone get so emotional and triggered over a resignation, ever?

people will pull him apart if he ever said anything racist or islamophobic. completely unravel him. i just dont know enough and im just one person lol. maybe hes in a crisis and hes interested in religion or islam, maybe hes just too embarrassed to admit it. i dont care if he is or isnt interested in islam, that is none of my business. how you learn about religion isnt by stalking a resigned employee, you can just go on wikipedia, dumbass. i dont know. what is fueling the obsession, i have to figure that out because its really bothering me that someone out there is this obsessed with me.

ok im tired i have to sleep

i don't know what his end goal is because i just dont know enough about the other side, but what exactly is his end goal?
