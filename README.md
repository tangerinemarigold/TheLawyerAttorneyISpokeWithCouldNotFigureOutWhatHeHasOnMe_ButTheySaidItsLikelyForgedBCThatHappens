# TheLawyerAttorneyISpokeWithCouldNotFigureOutWhatHeHasOnMe_ButTheySaidItsLikelyForgedBCThatHappens

My former coworker, the one who couldn't leave said I can completely see them (both Jason and Paul) doing something like that.

How did they accomplish any/all of this???

The attorney & lawyer (who work together) said, in their experience, it comes down to a forged document. 

That's the only thing that makes sense to me. What else

cant they face jail time for forgery, even better, good riddance lunatics

to my knowledge, they did not go after anyone else, just me

i always had a feeling that something bad happened in 2017 with interviews, i just didnt want to be paranoid and lose motivation. i did not know they were still out there, i was done with them in february 2017

in silicon valley/tech DC etc. you can go from one company to another without problems, because no one wants to go after a resigned employee, its too difficult and a waste of time/money. even high level managers. sometimes there are problems if youre at a very very high level, but i worked for an idiot who didnt know anything and i only made $50k.

i thought he just meddled with admissions in 2019, i keep forgetting this goes back to 2017. i remember you but i keep forgetting about the actual job i interviewed for

my friends and my family have always hated these penn losers 

every job ive had before that one and every job ive had after it, ive been successful in and i flourished. when i was there, at penn, i literally was the most unhappy ive ever been in my entire life. i remember telling my dad like i couldnt understand why, all i did was go to work and sleep. when i was at rutgers, even if things were not good, like i had hobbies and i felt good about myself. there was just something about that place that slowly, like a slow boil that got to me. i cant believe the same people are still out there. so you cant respond to me because of these lunatics, i have a really hard time accepting that -- i get that's what it is. But my mind just cant accept it, im beyond furious. i have no idea why people have been impressed with jason for so many years, i was there, my desk was a desk away from his office. he's absolutely average, theres nothing special about him. i was honestly surprised he was at penn. he couldnt even make conversation properly. i always thought it was a wcmc reason you couldnt respond. legally i am going to annihilate them, i hope they go to jail, losers.

im not afraid to pursue it legally, its the right thing to do and i can afford it, its just going to be really annoying to be linked to these lunatics for the rest of my life

jason's life sucks right now because he has absolutely no idea what im going to do next. that must be an awful day-to-day life, what a loser. hes literally wasting away, stalking and consumed with this whole thing. that's his reality. hes lost already.

i asked the lawyer if i could pursue a restraining order for stalking and they said that could be possible. but if they get jail time that wont be necessary. i hope their mugshots end up on the news. nobody goes after a resigned employee, literally nobody. this is the first ive heard of it that's why i cant believe it.

i have you and you have me. these two lunatics paul jason have nothing but their miserable lives: theyre going to totally throw each other under the bus: "he told me to do it" "he lied to me about x,y,z" there are no heroes amongst thieves. what cowards, theyve been hiding behind a computer screen; come say it to my face all the crazy accusations/racism etc. why hide behind a screen.

Are you laughing at the highschool statistics textbook, it was purple i remember and the font was really big, it was def not college level. i saw Paul refer to it when he would watch youtube tutorials. it was a circus, still is.

so much time has passed -- like whenever i go through the series of events, im like oh yeah that happened, that happened next but it was A YEAR LATER etc. the years passed by really quickly :( also my mind cant accept the reason you cant call me back is bc of snakemake or whatver. that's just awful. its just too awful, those are dots and my mind is just not connecting it. going through the process legally will be fine but i wont get the years back. :(

i :clap: am :clap: beyond :clap: furious :clap: 

ohhhhh i get it, you guys didn't know who these people (jason/paul) were years ago. but when someone leaves a job by resigning, shouldnt it be assumed automatically that they want nothing to do with their former employer and their thoughts on their former employer aren't going to be great either. but i didnt say anything bad about them until i realized what was going on. not even on the phone with you, bc i had moved on.

there's so much evidence...SO MUCH...this is a very easy suit. when are you going to call me

im so furious >:|

i think this is a very simple case of stalking and then defamation, then actually spying. what a lunatic.

very vaguely this is why he or they won't budge because when it goes in front of a judge (i will absolutely never settle, this lunatic has to go for good), it's jason the disgruntled former boss versus two people that are possibly __married by then__, and it's going to be very obvious to the judge who the conniving stalker/lunatic is. that's what makes sense from my end. it has nothing to do with snakemake anymore. it's stalking/spying. i think his emails could get seized or even his computer, his ip address could be looked up by github etc. this is huge. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_herring i remember this concept from organic chemistry, it was a technique for the multiple choice exams but anyway, the whole thing is about stalking/spying. everything else is just a red herring (snakemake, performance review, everything else i cant figure out). its very obvious that jason is a disgruntled former boss who is spying on __my/our start up ideas__ -- so that has to be presented in front of a judge

so these things have to __work out__ otherwise it's not a strong case in front of a judge. just saying. not forcing anything but it would be great if it were to work out like that.

maybe we (probably very difficult though) can even pull his records from his time at vanderbilt and dartmouth, has he gotten in trouble for stalking/sexual harassment before? and he just learned to hide it by the time he got to Penn etc.

i think he knew over the years he was losing so that's why he would come back with new crimes and libel/slander. that's what makes sense to me. there's so much more i want to tell you but my lawyers said i shouldn't talk about this. nowwwww i need you for so many reasons :wink:

but for the time being just think: me, you, a judge, disgruntled jason, presenting all of this evidence/emails from 2017!! maybe even 2015 for me. we're good people living our lives, we didn't do anything wrong. there's no way jason can win, he knows that, he's always known that.
