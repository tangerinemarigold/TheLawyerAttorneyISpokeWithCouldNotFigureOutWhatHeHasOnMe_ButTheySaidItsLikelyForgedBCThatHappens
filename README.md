# TheLawyerAttorneyISpokeWithCouldNotFigureOutWhatHeHasOnMe_ButTheySaidItsLikelyForgedBCThatHappens

My former coworker, the one who couldn't leave said I can completely see them (both Jason and Paul) doing something like that.

How did they accomplish any/all of this???

The attorney & lawyer (who work together) said, in their experience, it comes down to a forged document. 

That's the only thing that makes sense to me. What else

cant they face jail time for forgery, even better, good riddance lunatics

to my knowledge, they did not go after anyone else, just me

i always had a feeling that something bad happened in 2017 with interviews, i just didnt want to be paranoid and lose motivation. i did not know they were still out there, i was done with them in february 2017

in silicon valley/tech DC etc. you can go from one company to another without problems, because no one wants to go after a resigned employee, its too difficult and a waste of time/money. even high level managers. sometimes there are problems if youre at a very very high level, but i worked for an idiot who didnt know anything and i only made $50k.

i thought he just meddled with admissions in 2019, i keep forgetting this goes back to 2017. i remember you but i keep forgetting about the actual job i interviewed for

my friends and my family have always hated these penn losers 

every job ive had before that one and every job ive had after it, ive been successful in and i flourished. when i was there, at penn, i literally was the most unhappy ive ever been in my entire life. i remember telling my dad like i couldnt understand why, all i did was go to work and sleep. when i was at rutgers, even if things were not good, like i had hobbies and i felt good about myself. there was just something about that place that slowly, like a slow boil that got to me. i cant believe the same people are still out there. so you cant respond to me because of these lunatics, i have a really hard time accepting that -- i get that's what it is. But my mind just cant accept it, im beyond furious. i have no idea why people have been impressed with jason for so many years, i was there, my desk was a desk away from his office. he's absolutely average, theres nothing special about him. i was honestly surprised he was at penn. he couldnt even make conversation properly. i always thought it was a wcmc reason you couldnt respond. legally i am going to annihilate them, i hope they go to jail, losers.

im not afraid to pursue it legally, its the right thing to do and i can afford it, its just going to be really annoying to be linked to these lunatics for the rest of my life

jason's life sucks right now because he has absolutely no idea what im going to do next. that must be an awful day-to-day life, what a loser. hes literally wasting away, stalking and consumed with this whole thing. that's his reality. hes lost already.

i asked the lawyer if i could pursue a restraining order for stalking and they said that could be possible. but if they get jail time that wont be necessary. i hope their mugshots end up on the news. nobody goes after a resigned employee, literally nobody. this is the first ive heard of it that's why i cant believe it.
